## Challenges
I have came across a lot of blockers, pitfalls and my solutions during each logic section of building this app. They are documented in each of my PRs. To summarize, some of the biggest challenges are:
- Conventions and quirks using Next.js 
- Setting up Auth.js and configuring JWT session strategy
- Prisma schema update, migration and seeding
- Choosing filtering strategy: from search params change to zustand states to UI, or from zustand state change to search params to UI?
